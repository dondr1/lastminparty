**Last Min Party**
-a  React Native social events application where users discover events through a swipe interface and hosts curate their guest lists through a two-way approval system.

## What It Does

Hot Swiper reimagines event discovery and attendance by combining the intuitive swipe mechanics of dating apps with a curated guest list experience. Instead of traditional event RSVPs, users and hosts both have control over who attends.

### The Core Concept

**Two-Way Matching System:**
- Users swipe on events they're interested in
- Hosts review and approve users who showed interest
- Only mutual matches result in event attendance

This creates higher quality events with engaged attendees and gives hosts control over their guest list.

## How It Works

### 1. Discover Events

Users browse through a feed of upcoming events in a Tinder-style swipe interface. Each card shows the event details, host information, and event type (open or invite-only).

- **Swipe Right** = Interested in attending
- **Swipe Left** = Not interested

When a user swipes right, they're added to that event's waitlist.

### 2. Host Reviews Waitlist

![Manage Event Screen](screenshot_manage_event.png)

Event hosts can see everyone who swiped right on their event. The host then reviews each interested user's profile and decides:

- **Accept** = Send them an invitation
- **Reject** = Remove from waitlist

Hosts can see user profiles including their avatar, username, bio, and interest tags to make informed decisions about their guest list.

### 3. User Receives Invitation

When a host accepts a user, the system automatically creates a formal invitation. Users can see all their pending invitations in their inbox.

### 4. Join Event

![Your Events Screen](screenshot_your_events.png)

Users can accept or decline invitations. Once accepted, they're added to the event as an official participant.

The "Your Events" screen shows two tabs:
- **Attending** - Events you've joined
- **Hosting** - Events you created

Each event card displays:
- Event title and details
- Date and time
- Host information with avatar
- "OPEN" button to view event details
- "Leave" button to exit the event

## Why Two-Way Matching?

Traditional event platforms have issues:
- **Open RSVPs** lead to flaky attendees and no-shows
- **Invite-only** requires hosts to know everyone beforehand
- **Public events** can attract unwanted guests

Hot Swiper solves this by:
- Requiring interest from both sides
- Letting hosts curate without prior connections
- Creating accountability through mutual selection
- Resulting in higher quality, more engaged events

## Tech Stack

Built with:
- **React Native** + Expo for cross-platform mobile
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Supabase** for backend (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **React Navigation** for screen routing

## Database Architecture

The app uses a relational database with these core tables:

- **profiles** - User information and preferences
- **events** - Event details and host info
- **event_swipes** - Tracks user interest (like/nope)
- **host_event_decisions** - Tracks host approvals (accept/reject)
- **event_invites** - Formal invitation records
- **event_participants** - Final confirmed attendee list

This multi-stage flow ensures quality control at each step of the event joining process.

Built for hosts who want control and attendees who want authentic event experiences.
